# ngs-validation-tools

The following scripts have been useful for different steps of the mitochondrial disorders validation.  Note that these some of the scripts require other tools, such as BWA, GATK, and samtools.  Some of the scripts have not been streamlined and the coding is suboptimal.  Any programs required for these scripts can be downloaded from sourceforge.com.  

NOTE: Most of these programs will need to have directory paths modified, as these were written for internal use only.
